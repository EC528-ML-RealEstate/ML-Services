# MachineLearning-InCommercialRealEstate
## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Our goal is to help the BLDUP create a machine learning platform to analyze housing and construction project data. We will be adding several different machine learning models and deploying them as independent microservices exposed by a simple API interface. 

Goals:
- Identify BLDUPs data analysis main shortcomings
- Create and train 2-4 machine learning models
- Create web API to expose the models functionality
- Deploy all models as microservices that can be used by BLDUP to improve their platform

** **

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

The BLDUP is a B2B platform for users who want to trade properties directly to the business owner or look for recent information about certain properties or construction projects. 

It does target:
- Individuals looking for new opportunities to trade/buy properties
- Companies looking for new opportunities to trade/buy properties
- Individuals who are employed by companies within the construction industry
- Individuals looking to understand housing and construction data

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:
This project will be scoped to the following:
- Identifying several machine learning classification and estimation use cases with BLDUPs currently acquired data.
- Training, testing and deploying at least 2-4 learning models.
- Design and develop an API interface in order to extract data from the trained models.
- Develop a microservice framework that can be used to deploy and maintain each of the machine learning models.

## 4. Solution Concept
High-level outline of the solution:
There are two main shortcomings of the current BLDUP service. First, it does not classify different types of construction work well using the current data processing pipeline. Second, blank images are used as placeholders whenever the service isnâ€™t able to find suitable images of the construction project. Machine learning can be used to mitigate these shortcomings. We plan to explore state of the art models (classification (regression, CNN, MLP)) to address the first project categorization problem. For the image generation goal, we plan to explore generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate arbitrary images related to each individual type of real estate construction project.
